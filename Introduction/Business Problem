Introduction/Business Problem

A real estate company assigned us the task for analyzing the locations of Pizza/Chinese/Burger/kebeb restaurants in New York. They asked us to create a dynamic map and distinguish the different 
types with color. The client want to use this map in order to propose to customers suitable locations according to their restaurant type investment.
